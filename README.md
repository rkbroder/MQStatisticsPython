# MQStatisticsPython
Several PYTHON scripts that use MQ features to capture various MQ statistical information.

These scripts run using PYTHON 3.8 on Linux and Windows. They require PYMQI 1.12 or the most recent version.

The scripts use MQ base commands (INQ Channels Stats, INQ Queue Stats) and also exercises the MQ System sample program amqsrua.

The scripts show how to execute the commands and parse through the data. The end result will be an output CSV file that can
be imported into EXCEL.
